# FR-ERP
An ERP attendance system using face Recognition.
The system uses deep learning to gain the information of the sample pic given and also uses this to identify the unknown person and make an attandce for the person.
FaceERP_V1 : the first prototype for the attandance system is trained with only one person's face and when it detects the person it prints a message "Welcome to class ________".
